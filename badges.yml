build:
  - uses: "actions/setup-node@v4"
  - name: "Build"
    run: |
      # Example build command for a browser extension
      echo "This is a placeholder for build commands for a browser extension."
      # Typically, you would have commands here to build your extension artifacts.
      # For example: npm run build
      # Or if using a specific bundler like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite:
      # npx vite build

coverage:
  - name: "Code Coverage"
    run: |
      # Example coverage command
      echo "Placeholder for code coverage generation command."
      # e.g., npm test -- --coverage

lint:
  - name: "Linting & Formatting"
    run: |
      # Example linting command using a common JS linter like ESLint or Biome
      echo "Placeholder for linting command."
      # e.g., npm run lint
      # Or if using Biome:
      # npx @biomejs/biome lint --apply ./
      # npx @biomejs/biome format --apply ./

test:
  - name: "Unit & E2E Tests"
    run: |
      # Example test command using Vitest or Jest
      echo "Placeholder for test execution command."
      # e.g., npm test
      # Or for Vitest:
      # npx vitest run
      # For E2E tests with Playwright:
      # npx playwright test

# Note: The actual commands in badges.yml are configuration for CI/CD runners
# rather than direct execution commands. The above are illustrative placeholders.
# In a real scenario, you'd configure the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml)
# to generate and report these metrics, which badges.yml would then consume.
# This badges.yml structure assumes a setup where these are used by a CI/CD tool.
# For Shields.io badges, the CI/CD pipeline needs to be configured to output
# coverage reports to a service like Codecov or upload results that can be
# queried by GitHub Actions (e.g., for build status).
